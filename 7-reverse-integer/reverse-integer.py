class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        rev = int(str(abs(x))[::-1])
        return (-rev if x < 0 else rev) if rev.bit_length() < 32 else 0

# This approach is faster than other approaches, for example: join() and reversed().

# Python's bit_length() is useful, it returns the number of bits required to represent an integer in binary.

# We can utilize this and create a compound conditional statement for dealing with the assumption of 32-bit signed integer range.
